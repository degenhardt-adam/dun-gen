image generation
    store dungeon data in session
    add endpoint(s) for images
        generate image based on dungeon data
            use pillow
                ImageDraw
            algorithm for generation
                make image correct size
                    allow variable size
                    default to cropped
                choose starting location
                iterate through dungeon data and draw shapes
                draw tray
                write text on tray
            store as file-like object in memory
        send image
    add link to html
        maybe time to clean up html generation?
        how to specify image size?
            text field
